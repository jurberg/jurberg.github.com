    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm a Grails developer at work, so I've gotten used to convention over configuration for controllers.  I just create a class with a name that ends in Controller and place it the controller folder.  Each method in the controller is an action and it allows me to access that method via /controller/action/id.</p>




<p>While Node and Express have full blown Rails copies (such as <a href="http://geddyjs.org/">Geddy</a>), I want something simpler.  I prefer to use <a href="http://requirejs.org/">Require.JS</a> to help me manage my dependencies.  It includes a require method that allows me to load a module by name.</p>




<p>This gave me an idea.  What if I could make a /controller/acton/id route in Express and use require to dynamically load the controller.  I could then call the action on the controller as a key.  It turns out it's pretty simple:</a>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jurberg/5360006.js"></script>

<p>Now any module in app/controller that has a method that takes a request and response can act as a controller with no configuration.  This example responds to /health/index.  Since we set it up to go to index when there's no action, it will also respond to /health.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/99f7c50f17734aa0fb8a.js"></script>

<p>There are cases where your URL does not match /controller/action.  Grails allows you to setup a UrlMapping file that maps URLs to controllers.  We could setup a similar file in JavaScript:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jurberg/ebba91d0bdf5dbc57fff.js"></script>

<p>We can then loop thru the mappings and register them with Express:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jurberg/5360024.js"></script>

<p>With just Express, Require.JS and a few lines of JavaScript, I now have convention over configuration controllers</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When developing JavaScript, I like to break my code into modules and define what modules the depend on.  <a href="http://requirejs.org/">Require.JS</a> is a great tool for this, but it also means bringing in module loading.  I'm on a project using <a href="http://grails.org/">Grails</a> that has a moderate amount of JavaScript.  Grails provides a resource plugin that handles bundling of resources.  I would still like to use the Require.JS style of defining modules and their dependencies while still loading scripts the normal way so Grails is happy.</p>


<p>I ended up creating <a href="https://github.com/jurberg/define.js">define.js</a>.  This libary provides a simple 'define' and 'require' method.  The 'define' uses the global object to hold the modules so they are also available in html handlers.  Using the global object as the module list also allows us to treat third party libraries such as jQuery as dependencies.</p>


<p>The following example creates a module that depends on the domain.person module, jQuery and the window object.  Since we are using the global to store modules, we can treat jQuery and window just like any other dependency we have defined.</p>

<p>Using the global object to hold modules also allows us to access them in html</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The free lunch is over. To speed up applications we are told we must write multithreaded programs and avoid mutable state. Functional programming can help with it's immutable state. There's also Erlang with the Actor model or Clojure with it's software transactional memory. One other option to consider is single threading your code. Following are a few examples where single threading was used to scale applications.</p>
