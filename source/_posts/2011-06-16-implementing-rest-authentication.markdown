While there is not much written about REST authentication, there does seem to be a common theme among the few articles written about it that REST services should be authenticated by signing the query parameters using a private key and making the calls over HTTPS.  This posting will provide an example of the signing of query parameters using a simple Spring server. We'll provide a small twist by putting the authentication information in headers.
